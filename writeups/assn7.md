Solo portion:
[Using the 'Xshell' program, I opened two different terminals on my virtual
machine. One terminal acted as a server and the other acted as a client. 
First, hit 
"./apps/lab7 server tomahawk.postech.ac.kr 63970" on the server
terminal and let it wait, and then hit 
"./apps/lab7 client tomahawk.postech.ac.kr 63971" on the client terminal,
so both the server and the client were connected successfully. 
The text I typed in the server terminal appeared the same on the client 
terminal, and vice versa. 
After that, after Ctrl-D at the client terminal first 
and typing at the server terminal, it was printed in the server terminal
as well. 
However, it was also confirmed that what was entered in the client terminal 
did not appear in the server terminal.
Transfering files using these two terminals was also successfully performed. 
As a result of checking the hash value, it was found that the two contents 
were the same.
There is no part that changed the code.]

Group portion:
[My team's name is "(Simon) Lam".
My assignment partner's name is Yang Jun young and POVIS ID is sheepjun0330.
The results conducted with partners were not different from those conducted 
with two terminals alone.
It was conducted by changing the roles of the client and server from 
each other, and connection and communication were also conducted 
without problems. 
The file transfer was also successful, and 
it was confirmed that the two contents were the same.
There is no part that changed the code.]

Creative portion (optional):
